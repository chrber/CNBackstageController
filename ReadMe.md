## Overview

**`CNBackstageController` was a proof of concept and never found a place in a real application. Therefore it's no longer supported and development will be discontinued!**

-
`CNBackstageController` is an derivative of `NSWindowController` and a special impelementation to show you the content you would like to see. The goal of `CNBackstageController` is to provide the developer a slightly different interface for presenting an application.

It mimics the behavior youâ€™ve just seen in Notification Center of Mountain Lion. Instead of showing a normal window and menu bar an application build with `CNBackstageController` offer you a behind the Finder-like desktop and will be shown with smooth animations. The common use is an application nested as a statusbar item that is not visible in the Dock.

Here is a shot of the included example application:

This screenshot is the result of the **horizontal screen split** animation effect:

## Requirements
